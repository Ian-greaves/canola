The experiment was carried out to investigate gene expression patterns important for early vigour in canola.Total RNA was sequenced from brassica napus parents and hybrids. 
This was done in 3 time points and 4 different tissues

Time points: 4 days after sowing;
                     8 days after sowing
                     22 days after sowing; young leaf(leaf 5) and old leaf (leaf 2)

Reads were pair-ended reads at 150bp and run on an illumina-HiseqX

Samples include:
Sapphire1 = 1+
Westar10 = 2+
AV-Garnet = 3*
NX0052 = 4*
NX1132 = 5*
Sapphire1 x Westar 10 (F1) = 6+
Westar 10 x Sapphire1 (F1) = 7+
AV-Garnet x NX0052  (F1) = 8*
NX0052 x AV-Garnet (F1) = 9*
AV-Garnet x NX1132  (F1) = 10*
NX1132 x AV-Garnet (F1) = 11*
